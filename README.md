# PetGo Backend

Backend service for the PetGo application. Built with Spring Boot and Hibernate using PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## Database
A PostgreSQL database is required.
The database is not created automatically, so you must create it manually before running the backend.

For development profile, create a local database (example name: petgodb) and update the connection details in application-dev.properties.
